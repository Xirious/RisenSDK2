This script module modifies Risen's combat system so that the user, 
in order to complete combos, must place his or her mouse clicks at 
proper points in time. That way it prevents from click-fests.

Installation:

  Put Script_Anti-Click-Fest.dll in your Risen\bin\scripts folder.

The idea comes from Kuchenschlachter, thanks to him!
