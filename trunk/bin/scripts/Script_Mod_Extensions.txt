This script module introduces several new console commands (each having 
multiple sub-commands) which provide access to the Genome Engine's 
classes and functions.

Using the parameter auto-completion which has been extended for the new 
commands, a lot of typing effort can be saved. It includes switching 
between the clipboard text, previously used parameters and recent results.

This is particularly useful when dealing with commands that take GUIDs
as parameters (these can be retrieved and recorded via GetEntityGuid).

Usage:

  <Command> help
    (Display help for command and list sub-commands)

  <Command> <Sub-command> help
    (Display help for sub-command)

  <Command> <Sub-command> <Parameters>
    (Execute sub-command)

Commands:

  ColShape      (Access to a dynamic entity's collision property set)
  DynEntity     (Management of the current world's dynamic entities)
  Tools         (General utilities)
  World         (Management of worlds, sectors and layers)

Installation:

  Put Script_Mod_Extensions.dll in your Risen\bin\scripts folder.
