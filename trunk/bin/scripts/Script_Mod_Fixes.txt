This is a Script Modification example from the RisenSDK
that is intended to replace/override some of the script
functions in the /bin/scripts/Script_Game.dll to change
the behaviour and/or fix bugs in the Engine/Game logic.

The following modifications are included:

* "OnQuestSuccess_CloseQuestWine" is closing the quest
  "Caspar_TrickBronco" instead of "Bronco_ArenaFight".

* "GiveXP" no longer cuts experience points/level
  on level-up and always uses the genuine player.
  The creature no longer gains XP/level while the
  player is transformed into a Nautilus or Beast.

* "OnQuestChange" is used to fix the missing calls to
  GiveXP and ModifySkillValue on quest success if the
  "RetroQuestMessageSystem" is enabled in the Config.
  And the <ModifySkillsSuccess> array of the quest is
  applied to the genuine player if he is transformed.
