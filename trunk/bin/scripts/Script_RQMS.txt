This is a Script Modification example of the Risen SDK.
The "OnQuestChange" is used to fix the missing calls to
GiveXP and ModifySkillValue on quest success if the un-
supported "RetroQuestMessageSystem" is activated in the
Config. And the ModifySkillsSuccess array of the quests
is applied to the original player if he is transformed.
