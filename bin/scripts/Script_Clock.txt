This module adds the new console command "clock".
It returns the current system time and game time.

You can also assign a debug key to "OnDebugClock"
in your Config ("TestMode" must also be enabled).
"OnDebugClock" prints the information in the game
log or displays a dialog box (no game is running,
the game menu is opened, or the game is loading).

The current version can be downloaded online from
