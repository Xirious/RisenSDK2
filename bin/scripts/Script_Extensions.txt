This script module introduces variables for the Risen console, aswell as
several new commands (each having multiple sub-commands) which provide
access to the Genome Engine's classes and functions. Additionally, 
Script_Mod_Extensions provides some new info scripts.

Using the parameter auto-completion which has been extended for the new 
commands, a lot of typing effort can be saved. It includes switching 
between previously used parameters and recent results. This is 
particularly useful when dealing with commands that take GUIDs as
parameters (these can be retrieved and "recorded" via GetEntityGuid).

Operations on console variables support basic wildcards ('*' at begin
or end of a variable name). Also, variables can be executed. This
makes it is possible to set up console macros that, for example,
invoke multiple console commands at once. Console variables are
persistent (stored on the hard drive) and a variable can only be 
removed by setting it to '$'. #c is a special variable that provides
access to the clipboard. #r1, #r2, #r3, #r4 and #r5 hold recent results.

  <Command> help

    (Execute sub-command, passing a variable as parameter)

  #<Variable name, may contain wildcards>
    (Display one or more variables)

  #<Variable name, may contain wildcards> = <Parameters>
    (Set one or more variables)

  #<Variable name, may contain wildcards> += <Parameters>
    (Append text to one or more variables)

  #<Variable name, may contain wildcards> !
