                     (data/compiled/library/compiled_*.bin)

This script module adds the new command "library" to Risen’s console.
(see http://www.worldofrisen.de/english/article_273.htm for details)
The console command supports help (library help) and auto-completion
for both parameters (press the tabulator key to complete the params).

Usage:

  library <Command> <Library>

Commands:

  compile
  export

Libraries:

  audio
  camera
  combatspecies
  cursors
  effects
  focus
  fonts
  imageeffects
  imagelists
  infos
  music
  quests
  tutorials
  windows

Requirements:

  Physical files must be enabled (NoWatch=false, NoPhysical=false)
  See http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/showthread.php?t=844071

  The output directory should exists. The command creates it - but
  you might have to restart Risen to get it mounted by the engine.
