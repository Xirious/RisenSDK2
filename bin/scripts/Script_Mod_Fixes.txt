This is a Script Modification example from the RisenSDK.

It overrides the orignal "OnQuestSuccess_CloseQuestWine"
and closes the quest "Caspar_TrickBronco" instead of the
"Bronco_ArenaFight" (like the original script function).

"GiveXP" is overidden to avoid loosing experience points
(and possibly level) while reaching the next level step.
